# march-madness-predictor

## Discription
#### this is not the most clean code base I have writen becauase it was a 2 day challenge with only one help card from google.
I have always wanted to make an AI and with march madness coming up, or happening depending on when you read this, I though that this was the
perfect oportunity! I also wrote it in 2 days.    :)
### details
The actual AI has a model I deigned myself that combines brute force with natural selection. It is very hard to explain here so go take a look at the code base.
although I must apologise, thier is not a lot of comments and I will get to work on that rely soon.
